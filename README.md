# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

### Overview

This repo contains an R file titled 'run_analysis.R' which performs multiple steps of transformations to go from an original set of data to a 'tidy' set of data containing the mean of variables of interest for each subject and activity.

Codebook.md goes over the information presented in the original dataset as well as the final representation achieved through the use of the run_analysis.R script.
